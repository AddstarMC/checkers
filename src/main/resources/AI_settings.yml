# Definition file for all available AIs.  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - if you want to define
# new aliases or change the parameters for existing AI's, see the AI.yml file.
#
# "class" is the AI implementation being used.
#  "Standard" is the built-in AI engine; alpha-beta search
#  "Random" is a stupid random move selector for testing the AI framework
#
# "comment" is an optional comment which will be shown to players if they list the AI's
#
# "payout_multiplier" applies if Economy support is enabled.  Default is 1.0 - it could be
#   raised for tougher engines and lowered for weaker engines.
