#
# User-editable alias file defining all AIs available to Checkers.
# See "AI_settings.yml" for core AI definitions.
#
# Each entry below has an alias as the key, followed by one or more parameters for the AI that
# the alias uses.  You are free to change any of the alias keys below to a preferred name,
# or add/remove alias definitions.  You can also have multiple aliases referring to the same
# AI definition.
#
# These aliases are used for the "/checkers invite <ai-name>" command, and appear as the AI's
# displayed name (prefixed with "[AI]").
#
# The "ai" parameter is mandatory and must reference an AI definition in AI_settings.yml
#
# See AI_settings.yml for the default parameters for each AI.  The following parameters
# are useful to override when defining aliases:
#
# "enabled" - if false, this AI will not be randomly picked to join games (but it can still be
#   invited explicitly with "/checkers invite <ai-name>"
#
# "comment" - a short text string displayed to players who use "/checkers list ai"
#
# "payout_multiplier" - applies if Economy support is enabled; the player's winnings will be
#    multiplied by this value.  Default is 1.0 - it could be raised for tougher engines and
#    lowered for weaker engines.
#
# "command" - applies to "xboard" AIs; the command to start the external checkers engine for the AI.
